# Data Model Guide

This work-in-progress series talks through the key concepts of the Zaikio platform,
topic by topic. We would recommend working through the guides in the order below, unless
any are clearly not of interest for your desired use cases.

1. [Jobs](/integration/data-model-guide/jobs.html) is the starting point to understand
    the whole of the platform, and most people should begin here.
2. [Files](/integration/data-model-guide/files.html) covers how to create, access and
    interact with files on the platform.
3. [Orders](/integration/data-model-guide/orders.html) covers how to create orders.
4. [Production Strategies](/integration/data-model-guide/production-strategies.html) covers how to set up Production Strategies for impositioning.
