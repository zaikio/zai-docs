# The Redirect Flow

Zaikio supports the web application flow based on the standard [authorization code grant type](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1). In order to use this flow you need to create an App (which can be either public or private) in the Directory.

After your App has been created you can use this flow to identify users that visit your App.

In order to do so, four steps are necessary:

1. Your app redirects users to the Directory to request their identity
2. Users approve access in the Directory and are redirected back to your App
3. Your App exchanges the grant token received through the redirect into an access token
4. Your app uses the Directory API to query user information
5. Integrate the [Launchpad](/guide/launchpad/) on your website

## Requesting a user's identity

To start the web application OAuth flow, you need to redirect users that don't have a valid session for your App to `GET https://hub.zaikio.com/oauth/authorize`.

| Name                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `client_id` **required** | The client ID for your App as generated by the Directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `redirect_uri`           | The URL where users should be redirected by the Directory after authorisation is obtained. This URL needs to exactly match one of the URLs configured during App setup in the directory, it cannot contain any additional parameters. If omitted the user will be redirected to the first URL you specified during App setup                                                                     |
| `state`                  | You should set this parameter to a secure random string only known to your App, as a means of protection [against forgery attacks](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20187/oauth2-cross-site-request-forgery-and-state-parameter). This parameter can also contain any other arbitrary data. It will be reflected back to your App with the redirect after authorisation is obtained. |
| `login`                  | If provided, this email address will be suggested as the users login.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `signup`                 | If omitted or set to `true`, the Directory will allow the user to create a new account during the authorisation process. If set to `false`, a signup is not possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `scope`                  | A comma-seperated list of the scopes you want authorisation for. Please read the [scope guides](/guide/oauth/scopes.html).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Users are redirected back to your App by Zaikio

After a user has successfully logged into Zaikio and approved access for your App, Zaikio will redirect the user back to your App, based on the `redirect_uri` specified in step 1 or in your App configuration. The redirect call will contain the `code` parameter which you need to exchange for an access token in step 3. It will also contain the `state` parameter from the previous step. You should use the `state` parameter to ensure that the request originated from your App. If the `state` doesn't match the process must be aborted.

## Exchange the grant code for an access token

The final OAuth step exchanges the grant `code` that you received with the redirect from step 2 into a valid API token for the Directory. In order to perform the exchange you need to send a request to `POST https://directory.zaikio.com/oauth/access_token`. The following parameters must accompany the request:

| Name          | Required     | Description                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| client_id     | **Required** | The client ID for your App as generated by the Directory.     |
| client_secret | **Required** | The client secret for your App as generated by the Directory. |
| code          | **Required** | The `code` parameter from step 2.                             |

Depending on the HTTP `Accept` header send with your request, the response will either be plain text, JSON or XML and is described below:

## Retrieve user information via the Zaikio Hub API

In order to retrieve information about the current user (like email address, name and organisation memberships) you need to query the Directory V1 REST API at `GET https://hub.zaikio.com/api/v1/person`. Please note that contrary to the token exchange response, the API only responds with JSON. To authenticate against the API the `Authorization` header must be set to

```
Bearer <your API token>
```

where `<your API token>` must be replaced with the token you obtained in step 3.

An example call to this endpoint might look like this:

```
curl --request GET \
     --url https://hub.zaikio.com/api/v1/person \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer 749ceefd1f7909a1773501e0bc57d5b2'
```

## PKCE <Badge text="required for non-oauth-confidential" type="warn" vertical="middle"/>

OAuth 2.0 public clients are susceptible to the authorization code interception attack.

To prevent these attacks we support PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) as described in [RFC7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636).

::: warning
**For applications that are not "oauth_confidential" (like mobile apps and SPAs) the usage of PKCE is obligated!**
:::

### How include PKCE in the OAuth flow:

**1. Generate the code_verifier**
Before starting the authorization code grant, a random string called `code_verifier` is generated using the characters: [A-Z], [a-z], [0-9], "-", ".", "\_" and "~", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters.
See [RFC7636 4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636#section-4.1) for details.

:::: tabs
::: tab JavaScript

```js
function base64URLEncode(str) {
  return str
    .toString("base64")
    .replace(/\+/g, "-")
    .replace(/\//g, "_")
    .replace(/=/g, "");
}
const verifier = base64URLEncode(crypto.randomBytes(32));
```

:::
::::

**2. Generate the code_challenge**
In addition to the `code_verifier` a `code_challenge` is created. The `code_challenge` can be based on two different methods:
a) With `code_challenge_method` "plain" the `code_challenge` is exactly the same as the `code_verifier`.
b) With `code_challenge_method` "S256" the `code_challenge` is the SHA256 Hash value of the `code_verifier` - url safe base64 encoded (without trailing "=" see [RFC 7636 Appendix A](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636#appendix-A)).

**We strongly recommend to only use S256 as method!**

:::: tabs
::: tab JavaScript

```js
function sha256(buffer) {
  return crypto
    .createHash("sha256")
    .update(buffer)
    .digest();
}

const challenge = base64URLEncode(sha256(verifier));
```

:::
::::

**3. Adjust the authorization grant request**
Add the parameters `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method` to the authorization grant request, depending on which was used in the previous steps. The endpoint will return an error in case the `code_challenge_method` is not present or is a not valid one.
After a successful authorization the user will be redirected to your `redirect_uri` as usual and will contain the `code` parameter.

**4. Adjust the access token request**
When exchanging the `code` for an access token, add the parameter `code_verifier` to the request. If the provided `code_verifier` matches the previously used `code_challenge` (with the used method) the endpoint will return access tokens as usual.
If you originally used PKCE on the authorization grant you **MUST** submit a valid `code_verifier` for the access token exchange. Otherwise the endpoint will return an error.
